// Free-look for the chase camera, via the Pointer Lock API.

// This REPLACES the earlier position-mapped hover design (cursor position on
// screen -> a bounded lean angle). That design always had an edge somewhere —
// tuning EDGE_MARGIN only moved where the ceiling was, it couldn't remove it,
// because it read the cursor's ABSOLUTE position and a monitor is finite.
// Akul's ask ("mouse should never touch the edge, should wrap around and keep
// going") has no solution in that model: the browser gives no API to teleport
// the OS cursor from one edge to the other (that would be a real security
// hole — a page silently warping your mouse). The only way to get unbounded,
// wrap-around rotation is to stop reading cursor POSITION at all and read
// relative MOVEMENT instead, which is exactly what Pointer Lock provides:
// the OS cursor is captured and hidden, and every event reports how far the
// mouse moved since the last one (movementX/Y), with no ceiling — so yaw
// just accumulates forever and is wrapped into -PI..PI for storage, which
// reads as a true 360° turn with no edge to ever reach.
//
// These are OFFSETS applied on top of whatever the chase camera was already
// doing, not a replacement for it: with both at 0 the camera behaves exactly
// as it did before pointer lock engages.

// as one continuous turn once eased through the shortest-arc math below.
