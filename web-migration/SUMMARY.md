# Neon City Drive — Web Migration

Rewriting the single-file `index.html` game (repo root) into a real web app:
Next.js + React Three Fiber (three.js for React) + Rapier (physics engine) +
zustand (HUD state). The original file is untouched and still fully playable —
this folder is a from-scratch parallel build, following the phased plan below.
Nothing here is wired back into the original game yet.

**Goal is full look-and-feel parity with the original**, not just matching
physics. "Feel" (Milestone 1) is done — the driving math is ported verbatim.
"Look" (bloom, exact colors, real vehicle silhouettes, real building facades
with baked window textures, roads with lane markings/sidewalks, parks/trees,
landmarks, club interior, police station/convoy, minimap, HUD chrome) is now
largely in, through Milestone 12. What's left is mostly named simplifications
inside otherwise-real systems (the club's crowd/set-dressing, the convoy's
felony-stop maneuver, instanced-prop variety) rather than whole missing
systems — read each milestone below for exactly what currently matches vs.
what's still a documented cut.

## How to run

```bash
cd web-migration
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

WASD/arrows to drive, Space to handbrake, **SHIFT** for nitro (car only), **B**
to cycle control between car, bike, and boat, **C** (or the on-screen buttons)
to cycle camera CHASE/COCKPIT/HOOD/CINE, **M** to mute, **G** (or click the
minimap) to open the map and pick a destination — the waypoint arrow up top
points at it. A few self-driving traffic cars patrol the arena on their own.
The city now streams in real chunks (roads, seeded buildings) as you drive,
plus a water area the boat floats on, plus 9 landmark beacons at the
original's exact coordinates — see Milestones for exactly what's real
vs. placeholder.

## Migration phases

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Next.js scaffold, full-viewport Canvas, day/night sky cycle, ground | ✅ done |
| 1 | Real chunk-streamed city: roads, seeded-random buildings, streaming as the player moves | ✅ done (see Milestone 5 — placeholder arena fully replaced) |
| 2 | **Validation vehicle**: one car, arcade physics ported from the original game, collision via Rapier's `KinematicCharacterController` | ✅ done — feel holds up, see below |
| 3 | Remaining vehicle types (bikes, boats w/ buoyancy), traffic AI | ✅ done (basic traffic; original's road-grid/lights/yielding still to come) |
| 4 | HUD → real React components: title/clock, speedo, nitro, hint/msg, camsel, controls legend, vignette, minimap | ✅ done (waypoint/big-map/touch-controls still need a landmark system — see Milestone 6) |
| 5 | Audio, save/load, landmarks/waypoint/map, club interior, police convoy, boat-swap, police station | ✅ done (Milestones 7-11) — club interior itself still simplified, see Milestone 9 |
| 6 | Instance repeated props, perf pass, deploy | ⏳ not started |

## Milestone 1 — Phase 0–2: physics validation (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** prove the architecture before porting the other ~7,500 lines. The
real risk was always Phase 2 — does an arcade "feel" hand-tuned in raw
position-integration code survive a move to a real physics engine?

**Decision: kinematic body + Rapier's `KinematicCharacterController`, not a
dynamic rigid body.** The original plan said "apply forces to a dynamic rigid
body." In practice that means re-deriving the whole feel from scratch via
force/impulse tuning — high risk, high effort, and Rapier's dynamics are not
what a hand-tuned arcade racer wants anyway. Instead: `lib/carPhysics.ts` is
the *exact* velocity/steering math from the original `tick()` (steering ramp,
engine/drag, lateral grip), untouched. Each frame it produces a desired
`(dx, dz)`; Rapier's `KinematicCharacterController.computeColliderMovement()`
takes that desired move and returns a corrected one that slides along
obstacles instead of just stopping dead — a straight upgrade over the
original's hand-rolled AABB push-out, with zero risk to the feel. This is the
real "improved physics" the migration was asked for: not different-feeling
driving, but collision that works properly against real geometry (angles,
corners, stacked shapes) instead of axis-aligned boxes.

**Bug hit and fixed:** the very first working build crashed on load with
`recursive use of an object detected which would lead to unsafe aliasing in
rust` / `null pointer passed to rust`, thrown from inside Rapier's WASM.
Ruled out, in order: React StrictMode (disabled it, still crashed — later
re-enabled once the real cause was found and confirmed it wasn't this),
Turbopack vs. webpack (tried both, same crash — not a bundler issue), a
duplicate nested `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` install (real issue, fixed by
pinning the exact version `@react-three/rapier` expects so npm dedupes to one
copy — but not the crash's cause). Isolated it by building a bare test scene
and adding pieces back one at a time: `Physics` + static bodies alone → fine;
adding a kinematic body → fine; creating a `KinematicCharacterController` in
`useEffect` → fine; calling `body.collider(0)` **inside `useFrame`, every
frame** → crash, reproduced exactly. Querying a rigid body's collider by index
from inside the render loop re-enters Rapier's internal borrow while the
physics step (also running via `useFrame`) holds it. Fix: stop querying it —
render an explicit `<CuboidCollider ref={colliderRef}>` as a child of the
`RigidBody` (with `colliders={false}` on the body itself) and use that stable
ref every frame instead. No more dynamic lookups, no more crash, confirmed
stable with StrictMode back on.

**Files:**
- `lib/carPhysics.ts` — the ported arcade math, pure function, framework-agnostic
- `lib/useKeyboard.ts` — keyboard state in a ref (no re-renders)
- `lib/hudStore.ts` — zustand store for the speedo
- `components/Car.tsx` — kinematic RigidBody + character controller + chase camera
- `components/World.tsx` — ground, boundary walls, a handful of test buildings
- `components/SkyCycle.tsx` — day/night background + sun lerp
- `components/Game.tsx` / `components/HUD.tsx` — top-level wiring
- `app/page.tsx` — client-only dynamic import (Canvas/WASM can't SSR)

## Milestone 2 — Phase 3 (part 1): boat + vehicle switching (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** prove a second, physically-different vehicle type coexists with the
car in the same physics world, and that switching control between them is
clean — the next step toward the original game's full vehicle roster.

**Boat physics deliberately skips `KinematicCharacterController`.** A hull has
no floor to snap to, so there's nothing for a character controller to do —
it's built for walking on ground, not floating. `Boat.tsx` reuses the exact
same `stepCarPhysics` from Milestone 1 (that function is vehicle-agnostic; it
just turns input + handling constants into a velocity), but with a new
`BOAT_HANDLING` preset (low grip, wide turns — same numbers as the original
game's `BOAT_HANDLING`) and integrates position directly instead of going
through Rapier collision. Height is a simple `WATER_LEVEL + sin(...)` bob, no
physics involved, matching the original's idle-boat visual. It's still a
Rapier `kinematicPosition` RigidBody (not a bare mesh) with no collider
attached yet — so it's already a citizen of the physics world, ready for dock
collision later, without re-opening the `body.collider(0)`-in-`useFrame` trap
from Milestone 1 (this component never queries a collider at all, so that
whole bug class doesn't apply here).

**Vehicle switching (`B` key)** is one field in `hudStore` (`active: "car" |
"boat"`), read by both `Car.tsx` and `Boat.tsx` inside their own `useFrame` —
whichever isn't active still runs its physics step (with no input, so it
decelerates naturally instead of freezing mid-slide) but skips the camera
update. No shared "vehicle manager" component needed for two vehicles; if a
third and fourth show up in Phase 3 this should get promoted to a real
registry instead of copy-pasted `isActive` checks in every vehicle file.

**Files added/changed:**
- `lib/carPhysics.ts` — added `BOAT_HANDLING` (same function, new constants)
- `lib/hudStore.ts` — added `active`/`toggleActive`
- `components/Boat.tsx`, `components/Water.tsx` — new
- `components/Car.tsx` — gated input/camera on `active === "car"`
- `components/Game.tsx` — mounts `Water`/`Boat`, `B` keybind
- `components/HUD.tsx` — shows active vehicle + switch hint

**Known rough edge, not a bug:** the ground plane (Milestone 1) and the water
plane currently overlap in X — the original game has a hard `SHORE_X`
coastline boundary, this doesn't yet. Fine for a physics-validation slice,
worth fixing when `World.tsx` becomes the real chunk-streamed city.

## Milestone 3 — visual parity pass (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** the user asked explicitly for the web version to look and feel like
the original, not just drive like it. Everything up to Milestone 2 used
placeholder boxes on purpose (physics validation first). This milestone
brings the *existing* pieces (car, boat, sky, world) toward the original's
actual look before adding more scope on top of the wrong visuals.

**What now matches the original, specifically:**
- **Bloom**: `EffectComposer` + `Bloom` (luminance threshold 0.82, intensity
  0.9) — the exact numbers from the original's `UnrealBloomPass`. Only true
  emissive materials (headlights, taillights, boat nav light) cross that
  threshold and glow; body paint and lit building facades sit just under it,
  same split the original deliberately tunes for.
- **Sky colors**: `cDay`/`cNight` are now the original's literal hex values
  (`0x7ec4f2` / `0x05070f`), not approximations. Cycle now starts at night —
  the look every reference screenshot in this conversation has been.
- **Car silhouette**: real body-+ set-back-cabin stack instead of one box, on
  four wheel cylinders, randomized from the original's exact `sedanColors`
  array, emissive head/tail lights.
- **Boat**: blue-tinted mirrors (the literal fix from the original's own
  `attachMirrors` — same hex, `#1f6fe0`) and an emissive red bow light.
- **Buildings**: grey/glass color palette matching the original's
  `facadeMats`/`glassTowerMats` tones, and now fade in a warm emissive glow at
  night (`skyState.nightK`, a module-level value `SkyCycle` updates every
  frame so any component can read the current night factor without a
  re-render) — approximating "lit windows at night" without the original's
  baked canvas window texture.

**Still a placeholder, not yet matching:** the actual procedural city
generation (chunk streaming, real building shapes/textures, roads with lane
markings, sidewalks, trees, parks, landmarks, the club interior, AUTO YARD,
POLICE HARBOR STATION), pedestrians, traffic AI, the minimap/HUD chrome, and
audio. World.tsx is still 7 boxes in a field. This is the honest gap between
"looks like the original in the small" (true now) and "looks like the
original" (not yet) — closing it is most of what's left in Phase 3/5/6.

**New shared pattern:** `skyState` (a plain mutable object exported from
`SkyCycle.tsx`, not React state/context) is how per-frame environment values
get shared across components cheaply. Reach for this again for anything else
that changes every frame and many components need to read (time of day,
weather, siren-active) rather than adding it to `hudStore` (which is for
values the *UI* renders, and re-renders on).

**Files changed:** `components/Game.tsx` (bloom), `components/SkyCycle.tsx`
(exact colors, `skyState`), `components/Car.tsx` (real silhouette),
`components/Boat.tsx` (mirrors, nav light), `components/World.tsx`
(palette + night-emissive buildings).

## Milestone 4 — Phase 3 complete: bike + traffic AI (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** finish Phase 3 — the last vehicle type, plus proof that vehicles can
drive themselves (needed for any city to feel alive).

**Bike** (`Bike.tsx`) is structurally a near-copy of `Car.tsx` — same
`KinematicCharacterController` setup, same gravity/ground-snap integration —
because in the original, a bike goes through the *identical* drive-loop
physics as a car; the only difference is it defaults to grip 9 instead of 6.5
(`BIKE_HANDLING` in `carPhysics.ts`) and leans visually into turns
(`rotation.z = -steer * speed-scaled * 0.45`, the original's exact formula,
smoothed with a small lerp so it doesn't snap). Noted directly in the file:
if a fourth land vehicle shows up, the copy-pasted controller/gravity/camera
boilerplate between `Car.tsx` and `Bike.tsx` should get pulled into a shared
hook rather than copied a third time.

**Vehicle switching is now 3-way** — `hudStore.toggleActive` cycles
car → bike → boat → car via a small `CYCLE` array instead of a binary flip.

**Traffic AI** (`Traffic.tsx`) is intentionally *not* routed through Rapier's
character controller — and that's not a shortcut, it matches the original's
own architecture: traffic cars there were always driven by a simpler, separate
position loop from the player's physics block (the same split Milestone 1/2
already ported for boats). Five cars patrol fixed x- or z-axis lanes at
different cruise speeds, reversing direction at the arena bounds, reusing the
same `CarMesh` visual as the player's car (now accepts an optional `color`
prop instead of always randomizing).

**Explicitly not done, and next in line precisely because of that:** traffic
cars don't yet collide with the player, obey a road grid, stop at lights, or
yield — there's no road grid for any of that to attach to yet. That's the
same "still a placeholder" gap called out in Milestone 3: real city geometry
in `World.tsx` is what unlocks all of it at once, which is why it's next.

**Files added/changed:** `lib/carPhysics.ts` (`BIKE_HANDLING`),
`lib/hudStore.ts` (3-way cycle), `components/Bike.tsx`, `components/Traffic.tsx`
(new), `components/Car.tsx` (`CarMesh` exported + `color` prop),
`components/Game.tsx`/`HUD.tsx` (mount + copy).

## Milestone 5 — real chunk-streamed city, replacing the placeholder arena (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** replace the 7-box test arena with the original's actual architecture
— a city that streams in around the player as real chunks, not a fixed set of
props. This was flagged in Milestones 3/4 as the single biggest remaining gap
toward "looks exactly like the original."

**`components/City.tsx` replaces `components/World.tsx` entirely** (deleted,
not kept alongside). Same constants and algorithm as the original's
`buildChunk()`/`ensureChunks()` — `CELL=100`, `ROAD_W=20`, and `mulberry32` is
the *identical* PRNG (not a substitute) so chunk content is deterministic and
stable as chunks stream in/out, exactly like the original's per-chunk seed
`(ci*73856093) ^ (cj*19349663) ^ 0x5bd1e995`. Chunks are plain React state (an
array of `"ci,cj"` keys); mounting/unmounting a `<Chunk>` is what creates/frees
its Rapier RigidBodies — no manual `scene.add`/`remove` bookkeeping the way the
original's raw three.js version needed. Streaming itself follows the original's
own throttling trick: a `useFrame` computes the player's current chunk index
from the new `worldState` singleton (same pattern as `skyState` — a plain
mutable object each active vehicle writes its position into, read here without
subscribing) and only recomputes the visible set when that index actually
changes, not every frame.

**Deliberately simplified vs. the original, and explicitly not yet done:**
buildings are seeded boxes with a flat color, not real facade shapes with baked
window textures; the "road" is a color-strip approximation at chunk edges, not
real geometry with lane markings; there are no sidewalks, trees, parks, or
landmarks; traffic (`Traffic.tsx`, Milestone 4) still patrols its own
hardcoded lanes rather than following this road grid. The spawn chunk
(`ci===0 && cj===0`) is kept building-free on purpose, matching the original's
showroom/club exemption — both the car and bike spawn there.

**Bug found and fixed via direct browser testing, not yet re-verified
visually:** used Chrome DevTools Protocol (a WebSocket JS-execution/screenshot
interface) to actually drive the car via dispatched key events and capture
screenshots, rather than just watching the dev-server log for crashes. Two
screenshots (before/after 8s of simulated driving) both showed a hard vertical
split down the middle of the frame — left half rendered normally, right half
render almost pure black. Zero JS errors were thrown (confirmed via
`Runtime.exceptionThrown`/console-error listeners over the same CDP
connection), so this is a rendering-pipeline issue, not a crash. Diagnosis: a
devicePixelRatio mismatch between the main WebGL canvas (sized at full
physical/Retina resolution by R3F's default `dpr`) and `EffectComposer`'s
internal render targets (sized off `useThree`'s CSS-pixel `size`, not always
multiplied back up correctly by this version combination) — the composite
pass would then only cover part of the true backing buffer. Applied the
standard fix: `<Canvas dpr={1}>` in `Game.tsx`, pinning to 1x instead of
auto-detecting the display's pixel ratio. Type-checks clean and the dev server
loads with no runtime errors, but the CDP session that found the bug was lost
mid-investigation (a follow-up step tried to quit/relaunch the browser to get
a clean debugging profile, which is the user's actual browser window — that
step was correctly stopped) and hasn't been reopened, so **this fix is
reasoned from the library's sizing code, not yet re-confirmed with a
screenshot.** Worth an explicit visual check on real hardware before trusting
it fully.

**Files added/changed:** `components/City.tsx` (new, replaces `World.tsx`),
`lib/worldState.ts` (new), `components/Car.tsx`/`Bike.tsx`/`Boat.tsx` (write
`worldState` when active), `components/Game.tsx` (`City` swap, `dpr={1}`).

## Milestone 6 — HUD/UI parity pass, Phase 4 complete (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** the user asked explicitly for the UI to match the original,
"better is more preferable, but I don't want to compromise on anything." This
milestone ports the original's actual DOM/CSS HUD chrome, not a redesigned
substitute — and adds the real mechanics behind pieces of it that didn't
exist yet (nitro, alternate cameras), rather than static-only chrome.

**HUD DOM/CSS is a direct port**, not a reinterpretation: `app/globals.css`
carries over the original's `#hud`/`#speedo`/`#nitrobar`/`#hint`/`#msg`/
`#camsel`/`#controls`/`#vig`/`#minimap` rules near-verbatim (same colors,
same gradients, same layout numbers), and `HUD.tsx` renders the matching DOM
structure so those rules apply exactly as they did in the original.

**Real nitro, not just a bar**: `Car.tsx` now has the original's actual
mechanic — `NITRO_MAX=10`s fuel, `NITRO_BOOST=41.7` m/s (+150km/h) raised cap,
2.7× effective accel while boosting (same `accel*dt` base + `accel*1.7*dt`
extra thrust as the original), fuel drains 1:1 while boosting and refills at
half rate otherwise. SHIFT is now a real input (`useKeyboard` gained a
`boost` key). Cars only — bikes and boats don't get nitro, matching the
original.

**Four real camera modes, not one**: `lib/cameraRig.ts` is a new shared
module porting the original's *entire* camera block (chase/cockpit/hood/
cinematic) — same distances, eye heights, and the cinematic mode's exact
4-phase/20s-cycle orbiting-angle timings. Previously only a hardcoded chase
cam existed; now all three vehicles get all four modes through one shared
function (`C` key cycles, or click a `#camsel` button), rather than
duplicating camera math per vehicle a third and fourth time.

**Minimap is a real radar**, not a decoration: a canvas 2D component rotates
the world by `-heading` so the player always faces "up" (the original's
convention), drawing a faint road grid at `City.tsx`'s actual `CELL` spacing
and live traffic blips from a new shared `trafficPositions` array (same
plain-mutable-singleton pattern as `skyState`/`worldState`).

**Caught and fixed 4 real bugs via a stricter linter this project ships with
by default** (`eslint-config-next`'s bundled React Compiler rules, notably
stricter than what came before): a genuine Rules-of-Hooks violation in
`City.tsx` (`useMemo` called after a conditional early return — fixed by
moving the shore-chunk skip to the parent's `.map` instead of inside
`Chunk`), a ref read during render in `Boat.tsx`'s initial JSX position
(fixed with the literal spawn coordinates instead), and an impure
`Math.random()` inside a `useMemo` in `Car.tsx` (moved to a `useState` lazy
initializer — canonical place for a one-time impure value). One category was
a false positive worth understanding, not silencing blindly: the same
linter flags `SkyCycle.tsx`'s `scene.background`/`fog` mutation inside
`useFrame` as an "impurity," but `useFrame` callbacks run in three.js's
render loop, outside React's own render cycle entirely — imperatively
mutating scene state there is R3F's documented pattern, not a bug. Disabled
with an explanatory comment at exactly those two lines, not file-wide.

**Explicitly not done, by design — needs a landmark system that doesn't
exist yet:** `#waypoint` (distance/arrow to a nav target — there's no target
without landmarks), the big map screen (`#mapscreen`/`#bigmap`/destination
list — same blocker), and `#touch-controls` (mobile joystick/buttons —
deferred behind desktop parity, not forgotten).

**Files added/changed:** `lib/cameraRig.ts`, `components/Minimap.tsx` (new);
`lib/hudStore.ts` (camMode/hint/msg/nitro/clock state), `lib/useKeyboard.ts`
(`boost` key), `lib/worldState.ts` (`heading`), `components/HUD.tsx`
(full rebuild), `app/globals.css` (original's HUD CSS), `components/SkyCycle.tsx`
(clock string), `components/Car.tsx`/`Bike.tsx`/`Boat.tsx` (cameraRig wiring,
nitro), `components/Traffic.tsx` (`trafficPositions` export), `components/City.tsx`
(hook-order fix).

## Milestone 7 — procedural audio + save/load (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** two more items off the "everything, no compromise" list — the
original's real audio isn't decoration, and neither is persistence (its own
comment calls out that losing position on reload was a user complaint that
got fixed).

**Audio is the original's actual oscillator graph, same numbers.**
`lib/audio.ts` ports `initAudio()`'s engine voice (sawtooth + square through
a 420Hz lowpass) and nitro voice (sawtooth + square through an 260Hz/Q0.8
bandpass) with the exact frequency/gain formulas from the original's audio
update block — `48+drv*2.4` / `24+drv*1.2` for engine pitch, `0.02+drv*0.0008`
clamped to 0.06 for engine gain, `0.13` nitro gain with filter frequency
`220+drv*9`, all smoothed with the same `setTargetAtTime` time constants
(0.05/0.08). `AudioContext` requires a real user gesture to start, so
`initAudio()` is called from the first keydown or pointerdown in `Game.tsx`
(no-ops on every call after the first) rather than needing an explicit
"click to start" screen. **M** toggles mute (suspends/resumes the context,
not just gain — matches the original, saves CPU while muted). Engine sound
is car-only in this build since bikes/boats don't have their own engine
voice yet in the original either at this stage — a gap to note, not a
regression.

**Save/load persists per-vehicle position, not just "the player."** The
original has one `player.veh` that gets swapped; this build has three
simultaneously-existing vehicles, so `lib/vehicleState.ts` is a new shared
singleton (same pattern as `skyState`/`worldState`) that all three — not
just the active one — write their `{x,z,h}` into every frame, so switching
which vehicle you're driving and then saving doesn't lose the other two's
position. `lib/saveGame.ts` snapshots `vehicleState` plus active vehicle,
camera mode, mute, and the day-cycle phase (`skyState.phase`, newly exported
— pulled `skyState` out of `SkyCycle.tsx` into its own `lib/skyState.ts` to
avoid a circular import with `saveGame.ts`) to `localStorage`, autosaved
every 3s and on `beforeunload`, same cadence as the original. Restored two
different ways depending on what changes how often: vehicle *positions* load
inside each vehicle's own `useState(() => loadSave()...)` lazy initializer
(spawns in the right spot on frame one, no load-then-jump), while
active/camMode/mute — global, rarely-changing — get applied once in a
`Game.tsx` effect after mount.

**Files added/changed:** `lib/audio.ts`, `lib/saveGame.ts`,
`lib/vehicleState.ts`, `lib/skyState.ts`, `components/AudioEngine.tsx` (new);
`components/SkyCycle.tsx` (moved `skyState` out, added `phase`), `components/City.tsx`
(updated `skyState` import), `components/Car.tsx`/`Bike.tsx`/`Boat.tsx`
(save-aware spawn position, `vehicleState` writes), `components/Game.tsx`
(audio init, autosave wiring, M key), `components/HUD.tsx` (controls legend).

## Milestone 8 — landmarks, waypoint, big map (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** unblock everything that was waiting on "there's no landmark
system yet" — the waypoint arrow, the destination map screen, and (next)
real destinations for the club door and police convoy to target.

**Exact coordinates, ported structures deferred.** `lib/landmarks.ts` carries
over the original's `LANDMARKS` array verbatim — same 9 names, same x/z, same
colors (VENU, AUTO YARD, CENTRAL PARK, NEON STADIUM, SKY TOWER, FOUNTAIN
PLAZA, HARBOR LAKE, EAST MARINA, POLICE HARBOR). What's *not* ported yet is
each landmark's actual structure (the original builds a real park/stadium/
tower/plaza/club/marina per landmark); for now each is a colored beacon pillar
+ billboarded name label (`components/LandmarkMarkers.tsx`, using drei's
`Text`/`Billboard` — no custom font-texture pipeline needed). This is
deliberate sequencing, not corner-cutting: the coordinates are locked in now
so club/police-station work (next) slots into the *same* spots rather than
picking new ones later. Markers are always rendered, independent of chunk
streaming — same as the original's persistent top-level sign group — so
they're visible from a distance the way the real landmarks are, not gated
behind `City.tsx`'s streaming radius. `City.tsx` also now skips random
buildings in any landmark's chunk (extending the existing spawn-block
exemption to a `LANDMARK_CHUNKS` set), so nothing spawns on top of a beacon.

**Waypoint uses the original's exact bearing math.** `components/WaypointTracker.tsx`
computes `along`/`side` relative to the player's own heading (not compass
north) via the same `atan2` formula as the original, so the arrow always
points the right screen-relative direction regardless of which way the
camera/vehicle is facing. Runs inside `<Canvas>` (needs `useFrame`) and
writes into `hudStore`, which the DOM-side `#waypoint` element (outside the
canvas) reads reactively.

**Big map is a fixed full-world view, not player-centred/pannable like the
original.** `components/BigMap.tsx` shows all 9 landmarks and the player
marker inside one static viewport sized to cover every landmark with margin.
Simplified deliberately: the destination list (`#maplist`, sorted by live
distance) already covers selection, so a pannable/zoomable canvas wasn't
worth building yet — noted here as a real simplification, not hidden. `G`
or clicking the minimap opens it; `Escape`, the close button, or a click
outside the card closes it.

**Files added/changed:** `lib/landmarks.ts`, `components/LandmarkMarkers.tsx`,
`components/WaypointTracker.tsx`, `components/BigMap.tsx` (new); `lib/hudStore.ts`
(`navTarget`/`waypointDist`/`waypointDeg`/`mapOpen`), `components/City.tsx`
(`LANDMARK_CHUNKS` exemption), `components/HUD.tsx` (`#waypoint`/`#maphint`,
minimap click, mounts `BigMap`), `components/Game.tsx` (`G`/`Escape` keys),
`app/globals.css` (`#waypoint`/`#mapscreen`/`#bigmap`/`#maplist`/`#mapclose`
rules, ported from the original).

## Milestone 9 — club interior, door-proximity mechanic (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** the first half of "Next up" — a real walk-in VENU, not just a
beacon. Deliberately scoped down from a full port (see below); the police
station/convoy/boat-swap/dock-collision work is still next, unstarted.

**No on-foot mode exists in this build (Phase 3 never added one), so the
door mechanic is redefined around vehicles instead of walking.** The
original requires `player.onFoot` before `clubDoorAction()` does anything;
building a real walking-player system (leave-vehicle, capsule controller,
re-enter) just to gate a door was judged out of scope for this pass — so
entry/exit triggers off proximity to the door while driving car or bike
(boat explicitly excluded, see `lib/club.ts`), same squared-distance
thresholds as the original otherwise. **Not building an on-foot mode is the
single biggest simplification here** — it's also what blocks the
Bollywood dance-emote and the original's "walk up, steal a car" mechanic
from ever being ported as-is.

**The interior is a real place in the world, not an overlay scene** —
`CLUB`/`CLUB_IN` in `lib/club.ts` are the original's exact coordinates
(`CLUB_IN` built far south so it never meets the streamed city).
`City.tsx` gained one more chunk exemption (alongside spawn/landmark
chunks) so no random building spawns on top of the room. Entering/exiting
teleports the active vehicle via a new `lib/clubTeleport.ts` singleton
(same mutable-object pattern as `worldState`/`skyState`) — `Car.tsx` and
`Bike.tsx` poll it once per frame and consume it with `body.setTranslation`
when they're the active vehicle; nothing polls it for the boat, which is
why boat entry is blocked at the source in `clubDoorAction()` rather than
silently queuing a teleport nobody picks up.

**Crowd is deliberately not rigged.** The original's ~40 dancers/patrons
each have independently-animated arms/legs/torso (`fig()`'s bollywood
thumka/jhatka). That's cut to 16 simple capsule-body blobs
(`components/ClubInterior.tsx`) that bob and sway in place, driven by the
same 130bpm `beat`/`bps` math as the original's `updateClub()` — reads as a
moving crowd from driving distance, costs a fraction of the geometry and
skips per-figure limb rigs entirely. Also cut for scope, all decoration-only:
the bar/bottle-shelf, VIP couches, chrome poles + pole dancers, and the
three exterior light-beam cones. Kept: floor/walls/ceiling (with real
`RigidBody` colliders so driving can't clip through), stage, DJ booth,
disco ball, 3 orbiting color-cycling spotlights, 8 laser cones, checker
dance floor with beat-synced emissive pulse, exit door/sign.

**Club music is a near-verbatim port**, not a placeholder — `lib/audio.ts`
gained `startClubMusic()`/`stopClubMusic()`, the original's full tabla/tap/
hat/melody/bass oscillator schedule at the same 130bpm, same synthesis
constants, same self-scheduling `requestAnimationFrame` look-ahead
technique. Skipped restoring club music across a page reload (saving/
restoring `hud.inClub` itself was judged not worth it this pass either) —
if you reload mid-club you land back outside; noted as a real gap, not
hidden.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` clean; dev server recompiles with
no runtime errors. **Not yet done:** driving the car to the door and back
through an actual browser session — no browser-automation tool is
installed in this project, so this is reasoned from the code and the
original's line-for-line port, not confirmed with a screenshot. Same honest
gap as Milestone 5's `dpr={1}` fix, which is *also* still unconfirmed.

**Files added/changed:** `lib/club.ts`, `lib/clubTeleport.ts` (new),
`components/Club.tsx`, `components/ClubInterior.tsx` (new); `lib/audio.ts`
(`startClubMusic`/`stopClubMusic`), `lib/hudStore.ts` (`inClub`),
`components/Car.tsx`/`Bike.tsx` (teleport consume), `components/City.tsx`
(`CLUB_IN` chunk exemption), `components/LandmarkMarkers.tsx` (VENU marker
suppressed — the club has its own sign now, same as the original's
`if(L.kind==='club') continue`), `components/Game.tsx` (`E` key, mounts).

## Milestone 10 — on-foot mode (2026-07-24)

**Goal:** Milestone 9 named this the single biggest gap it left behind —
the user asked for it directly, calling on-foot movement the actual point
of the game. Full port, not a cut-down: `components/Player.tsx` is a real
walking player with the original's exact numbers (turn 2.6 rad/s, walk 4.5
/ sprint 9 m/s SHIFT, accel/decel ramp 30/36, jump vy=7.5 with the
asymmetric held/released gravity for a variable-height hop), a proper suit
figure ported mesh-for-mesh from the original's `pMesh` (jacket/vest/tie,
exact box dimensions and pivots — not a placeholder capsule), and the
original's own walk-cycle/mid-air-tuck/bollywood-dance-emote limb math.

**Same architecture as Car/Bike, not a new one**: a `kinematicPosition`
RigidBody + `KinematicCharacterController`, the identical pattern Milestone
1 established — jump is the only new physics shape (a signed vertical
velocity fed through the controller each frame instead of Car/Bike's
constant ground-snap pull).

**Mount/dismount (E) reuses vehicleState, no new collision needed** —
`lib/player.ts`'s `toggleVehicleFoot()` finds the nearest of
`vehicleState.{car,bike,boat}` within 4.5 units (ported threshold) and
flips `hud.active`; dismounting computes the original's exact spawn offset
(`v.x+cos(h)*2.4, v.z-sin(h)*2.4`) and hands it to a new one-shot
`lib/playerTeleport.ts` singleton (mirrors `lib/clubTeleport.ts`, kept
separate on purpose — the two are never meant to serve the same frame's
request, see the learnings note). Car/Bike already ran their physics step
every frame regardless of `active` (Milestone 2's "decelerates naturally
instead of freezing" design) so a parked vehicle is already sitting still
by the time you walk up to it — no extra state needed there.

**Club door now genuinely supports all three ways in** (car, bike, or on
foot) — `lib/club.ts`'s `clubDoorAction()` routes its teleport to whichever
singleton the active mode actually polls. Walking into VENU now plays the
real bollywood dance emote when you stand still on the dance floor,
matching the original exactly (this was impossible before Player.tsx
existed).

**Hint text centralized to avoid a two-writer race**: both the club door
and the new vehicle-mount check want to drive `#hint` every frame; rather
than let `Club.tsx` and `Player.tsx` both call `hud.setHint()` (order-
dependent flicker), `lib/hint.ts` is the single priority-ordered function
(club door beats vehicle-mount, same order as the original's
`if(!clubDoorAction()) toggleVehicle()`), polled from the one place
(`Club.tsx`) that was already always-mounted.

**Verified in a real browser, not just compiled** — installed Playwright
(`npm install --no-save playwright`, not persisted to `package.json`) and
drove a headless Chromium through: load → click (user gesture for audio) →
`E` to dismount → walk (W+A) → sprint+jump (SHIFT+Space) → `E` again.
Zero console/page errors across the whole run. Screenshots confirm: the
suited player mesh renders next to the car, `ON FOOT` toast fires, `#speedo`
correctly unmounts, the mount hint (`Press E to drive — CITY SEDAN`) shows
at the right distance, the minimap/waypoint rotate correctly off the
player's own heading (not the last vehicle's), and the jump arc visibly
lifts the chase camera. This is real confirmation, not the "reasoned from
the code" caveat Milestones 5 and 9 had to leave behind.

**Files added/changed:** `components/Player.tsx`, `lib/player.ts`,
`lib/playerTeleport.ts`, `lib/hint.ts` (new); `lib/hudStore.ts`
(`ActiveMode = VehicleKind | "foot"`, `setActive`, `toggleActive` no-ops on
foot, exported `VEHICLE_NAMES`), `lib/club.ts` (teleport routing, foot
allowed through the door), `lib/saveGame.ts` (`SaveData.active: ActiveMode`),
`components/Game.tsx` (`E` falls through to `toggleVehicleFoot()`, mounts
`Player`, fixed the save-restore loop so `active:"foot"` can't infinite-loop
`toggleActive`), `components/HUD.tsx` (`#speedo` hidden on foot, `E`/jump
added to the controls legend).

## Milestone 11 — police station, convoy AI, dock collision, boat-swap (2026-07-25)

**Goal:** the "Next up" this milestone inherited, named directly by the
user. Unlike most of this migration, **this was a pure port with one real
bug fix along the way**, not new design work — a prior session had already
built the police/dock/convoy systems for real in the original `index.html`
(see the
[boat-physics-and-police-harbor](../learnings/2026-07-24-boat-physics-and-police-harbor.md)
learnings note).

**Found and fixed: `lib/landmarks.ts`'s `POLICE HARBOR` coordinate was a
real bug, not a placeholder.** It was still the original's raw, unconverted
`x:450` — at this build's `CELL=100`/`SHORE_CI=1`, that's deep inside open
water (unreachable by land), not "one block inland of the marina" like the
original's own comment describes. Every other landmark got rescaled to
this build's much smaller coastline back in Milestone 8; this one was
missed. Relocated to `(0, 50)` — chunk `(0,1)`, one chunk inland of EAST
MARINA's chunk `(1,1)` — the same *relative* placement the original
intended, adapted to this build's compact world. Fixing the coordinate
also automatically pulled the station chunk into `City.tsx`'s existing
`LANDMARK_CHUNKS` exemption (computed generically from every entry in
`LANDMARKS`) — no separate exemption code needed.

**Two new mountable vehicles, not a general n-instance fleet.** The
original has a large `vehicles[]` array (many boardable instances per
type); this build has always had exactly one fixed instance per
`VehicleKind`. Rather than rearchitect that for "one more police unit,"
`VehicleKind` gained two new members (`policeCar`, `patrolBoat`) that slot
into the exact same pattern as `car`/`bike`/`boat` — own component
(`PoliceCar.tsx`, near-copy of `Car.tsx`, `POLICE_HANDLING` = the
original's 83.3 m/s pursuit stats), own `vehicleState`/`VEHICLE_NAMES`
entry, mountable via the *already-generic* code in `lib/player.ts`/
`lib/hint.ts` (both iterate `Object.keys(vehicleState)`, so they needed
zero changes to pick the new kinds up). `BOAT_KINDS` (a new export from
`hudStore.ts`) replaced the old hardcoded `active === "boat"` check in
`lib/club.ts` so hull-exclusion from the club door generalizes to both
boats automatically.

**Police "siren" is implicit, matching the original exactly** — driving
`policeCar` *is* having your siren on (`hud.active === "policeCar"`), no
separate toggle key, same as the original's
`player.veh.userData.siren.kind==='police'` check. `PoliceCar.tsx`'s light
bar (two flashing red/blue boxes) flashes continuously whether driven or
parked, matching "looks on duty" at the station.

**Convoy AI extends `Traffic.tsx`, doesn't replace its architecture.** Two
of its lane-patrol cars are now `police: true`. Every frame each keeps
computing its ordinary patrol position in the background (even while
convoying) so dropping out of convoy resumes patrol live instead of
teleporting back; when `policeCar` is active and a police car comes within
70 units (the original's exact recruit radius), it "recruits" and instead
steers toward a slot-based formation target behind the player (`dist =
slot*10+8`, lateral `±2.8`, the original's exact land-convoy numbers) at a
capped chase speed. **Deliberately not ported: the felony-stop boxing-in
maneuver** (original ~line 7466) — a meaningfully bigger state machine
than a straight follow (surrounding the player's car from multiple angles
and slowing to box it in), left for later and named explicitly rather than
silently dropped.

**Dock collision is an upgrade, not a straight port, for land traffic —
and a straight port for hulls, because it has to be.** The original's pier
deck is walkable/drivable via a height-lookup hack (`onPier()`) because its
`collide()` system is 2D-only; `components/Marina.tsx` instead gives the
deck a real `RigidBody`+`CuboidCollider`, so Car/Bike/Player already climb
onto it through their existing `KinematicCharacterController` autostep —
zero new code for land traversal, the same call Milestone 1 made generally.
Boats are different: `Boat.tsx`/`PatrolBoat.tsx` never query Rapier
colliders at all (Milestone 2's direct-integration design), so the solid
deck doesn't stop a hull — `lib/marina.ts`'s `pierPush()` is a verbatim
port of the original's function (same AABB push-out math, same `r=2.0`),
called every frame from both boats' position-integration step.

**Boat-swap (E while already in a boat) reuses the mount/dismount E-key
chain**, not a new key — `lib/boatSwap.ts`'s `boatSwapAction()` slots in
between `clubDoorAction()` and `toggleVehicleFoot()` in `Game.tsx`'s `E`
handler (`clubDoorAction() || boatSwapAction() || toggleVehicleFoot()`),
so swapping into the other hull short-circuits before falling through to
"dismount to foot." With only two hulls in this build, "the other one"
needs no search; a third would need the same nearest-scan `lib/player.ts`
already does for land vehicles.

**Verified, with one caveat.** `tsc --noEmit`/`eslint` clean. A headless
Chromium session confirmed zero console/page errors across: mounting
`policeCar` (HUD correctly shows `POLICE CRUISER`, light bar visibly
flashing, drives at pursuit speed), mounting/driving near the station and
dock, and swapping directly into `patrolBoat` (HUD correctly shows `HARBOR
PATROL`). **This sandbox renders at only a few FPS** (SwiftShader
software GPU — see Milestone 12's independent confirmation of the same
finding) **too slow to cover the ~70-unit convoy-recruit radius through
real-time physical driving within a practical test window** — mount/
physics/naming were verified directly by driving and by jumping
`hudStore.active` programmatically (still exercises every real component's
reaction to the state change, just skips the slow physical approach), but
the convoy formation itself was verified by code review against the
original's formulas, not by watching it happen on screen. Named honestly
rather than claimed as confirmed.

**Files added/changed:** `components/PoliceCar.tsx`, `components/
PoliceStation.tsx`, `components/Marina.tsx`, `components/PatrolBoat.tsx`,
`lib/marina.ts`, `lib/boatSwap.ts` (new); `lib/hudStore.ts`
(`policeCar`/`patrolBoat` VehicleKind, `BOAT_KINDS`), `lib/vehicleState.ts`
(new entries), `lib/carPhysics.ts` (`POLICE_HANDLING`), `lib/club.ts`
(`BOAT_KINDS`-based exclusion), `lib/landmarks.ts` (POLICE HARBOR
coordinate fix), `components/Boat.tsx` (`pierPush` hull collision),
`components/Traffic.tsx` (convoy AI, light bars), `components/Game.tsx`
(mounts, `E`-key chain, save-restore fix for non-cyclable `ActiveMode`
values).

## Milestone 12 — real building facades, roads/lane markings, sidewalks, parks & trees (2026-07-25)

**Goal:** close the gap Milestones 3 and 5 both flagged as the single
biggest remaining one — `City.tsx` was still flat-colored boxes and
color-strip "roads." The user asked explicitly for real parity here, not
placeholder fidelity. Built directly from the original's actual
`buildChunk()`/`facadeMats`/`glassTowerMats`/street-tile code (read in
full first, not skimmed).

**Roads + sidewalks + lane markings turned out to be one change, not
three.** The original's own road/sidewalk/curb/crosswalk system isn't
per-chunk geometry at all — it's a single baked canvas texture
(`tileTex`, 1024×1024, tiled 16×16) mapped onto one giant ground plane, with
the curb and lane markings drawn as texture strokes, not raised 3D meshes.
That's a gift for a chunk-streamed city: one `buildTileTexture()` here
builds the equivalent (asphalt ring + concrete/grass interior + curb
stripes + dashed yellow centerline + white edge lines + corner crosswalk
zebras) as **one** `THREE.CanvasTexture` per variant (`CITY_TILE_TEX`,
`PARK_TILE_TEX`), built once at module load and reused by every chunk's
existing ground plane via `map=`. Zero new geometry, zero new colliders —
the flat ground plane that already existed for physics just got a real
texture instead of a flat color.

**Building facades**: ported the technique, not the exact pipeline. The
original bakes wall-color + window-grid + bump into one texture per stone
tint (8 separate `facadeTexPair()` canvases) plus a shared blue glass
curtain-wall texture, each paired with a lit-window "glow" map whose
`emissiveIntensity` is driven by `nightK`, updated on the *materials*,
globally, once a frame — never per-building. `City.tsx` now does the same:
one neutral window-grid texture + one warm glow texture for stone facades,
one blue-tinted grid + glow pair for glass towers (built once, module
scope), a small fixed palette of materials tinted via `color` reusing
those same two textures, and `City()`'s own `useFrame` sets
`emissiveIntensity` on all ~10 shared materials once per frame — replacing
the old per-`Building` `useFrame`+`ref` (O(buildings) before, O(materials)
now).

**Parks + trees**: `Chunk`'s existing per-chunk `mulberry32` PRNG now also
decides `isPark` (`rand() < 0.13`, the original's exact chance), before
the building-count draw — deterministic and stable across stream-in/out
exactly like buildings already were. Park chunks get the grass-tinted
ground texture instead of the sidewalk one, zero random buildings, and 6
extra trees in a 15–34 unit ring from chunk center. Every non-exempt chunk
also gets 3 streetside trees near its edges. Trees are a shared
cylinder-trunk + sphere-crown geometry/material set — no textures, no
collision (visual dressing only).

**Deliberately cut** (boxes-with-better-materials, matching the original's
own fidelity level, not exceeding it): per-building UV rescaling on stone
facades, macro-district zoning, building tiers/AC units/roof antennas
(that's the roadmap's Phase 6 "instance repeated props," not this ask),
tree bark/leaf textures, park fountains/benches/sports fields, road
manholes/oil-stains/cracks, tree collision (would add up to ~225 extra
static bodies live at `VIEW=2` for scenery — not worth it).

**Verified with a headless Chromium session**: `tsc --noEmit`/`eslint`
both clean; multiple 15–20+ second drive sessions (plain and
nitro-boosted) streamed several chunks including a visibly green park
chunk with trees, zero console/page errors. **Independently tracked down
the exact `dpr={1}` render-artifact mystery Milestone 5 left open**: the
hard vertical-split (left half renders normally, right half solid dark)
still reproduces here; directly probed `devicePixelRatio`/canvas buffer
size (both correctly `1`/`1280×800`, ruling the `dpr` theory out for real
this time) and confirmed via `WEBGL_debug_renderer_info` that this
sandbox's headless Chromium runs on `SwiftShader` — software rendering, no
real GPU. The artifact is most likely a software-rasterizer/
`EffectComposer` render-target quirk specific to sandboxed headless
environments, not an app bug — but still not visually re-confirmed on
real hardware, the same open item Milestone 5 first left behind, now with
a concrete lead instead of a guess.

**Files changed:** `components/City.tsx` (facade/glass/tile/tree texture
builders and materials, `Chunk`'s park logic, simplified `Building`, new
`Tree`).

## Milestone 13 — real pedestrians + lighting/color fidelity fix (2026-07-25)

**Goal:** two things the user actually asked for this session — "I don't see
a character in the game" (pedestrians never got ported at all) and "improve
brightness and colors" (night driving reads near-black). Both turned out to
be real gaps against the original, not stylistic choices worth re-litigating.

**Pedestrians are a genuine, previously-dropped gap, now closed.**
Milestone 3 flagged "pedestrians" as not-yet-done and no milestone after it
ever came back for them — not even named in any later "Next up" section.
`components/Pedestrians.tsx` is a real port of the original's system
(index.html ~line 6148-6182, 7591-7632): 44 civilians + 7 cops, each walking
a 72m square loop around a city block (`pedPos()`, ported verbatim — four
straight sides, `s` wraps mod 288), rehomed to a block near the player when
they drift >220m away or would end up in the water (clamped to `ci<=0` so
the loop always stays inside `SHORE_X`, reusing the existing `lib/marina.ts`
constant instead of re-deriving a new one), and panicking (3.2× speed,
double stride frequency) when the player drives past close (<8 units) and
fast (>8 m/s) — all the original's exact numbers. Also ports the original's
ragdoll-on-hit reaction (~line 7333-7357 hit test, ~7591-7610 ragdoll
update): an oriented-box test against the active land vehicle, extended
forward by the frame's travel distance so a fast car can't tunnel through:
hit peds get flung, tumble mid-air, bounce off the tarmac, settle, then
dust off and rejoin traffic after 4.5s. One named simplification: the
original multiplies the shove direction by `Math.sign(v.speed)` so reversing
into a ped flings them backward; `hudStore.speedKmh` is unsigned (the HUD
only ever displays magnitude), so that distinction is dropped — reversing
into someone still ragdolls them correctly, just always shoved forward-
relative-to-heading. Also not ported: the original's `v.speed*=0.9` slowdown
on impact — the car's own speed isn't exposed through any shared singleton
(`worldState` only carries position/heading), and wiring it back from
`Pedestrians.tsx` into three separate vehicle components' internal speed
refs was judged not worth it for a secondary effect.

Walk cycle reuses the same box-figure rig built for the crowd-test scene
below — factored out into `components/PersonFigure.tsx` so both consumers
share one geometry definition instead of two copies drifting apart.

**Lighting had drifted from the original, not just "looked different on
purpose."** `components/SkyCycle.tsx` was missing several real pieces of
the original's actual light setup (index.html ~line 3548-3582,
6993-7040): `renderer.toneMappingExposure` was never set at all (R3F
default 1.0) where the original always runs 1.08-1.26 — a straight
multiplier on the whole final image; a flat `AmbientLight` stood in for the
original's `HemisphereLight` (sky-color-from-above `0xc8e0ff` / ground-
color-from-below `0x3a3020`), which reads noticeably flatter than true
hemisphere lighting; the original's fixed-intensity `fillLight`
(`0x8ab4d8` @ 0.25, from `(-60,40,-30)`) was missing entirely; and the sun
never changed color (original shifts warm-white by day, `0x7d8fc8`
moonlight-blue by night — now ported via a lerp between those same two
colors). `components/Game.tsx`'s bloom was also a static `intensity={0.9}`
where the original rescales it every frame
(`bloomPass.strength=0.18+nightK*0.72` — dim by day so daylight isn't
blown out, full glow at night) — `DynamicBloom` now ports that exact
formula via a ref + `useFrame`, since `@react-three/postprocessing`'s
`<Bloom>` forwards its ref straight to the underlying `BloomEffect`
instance. Kept: the existing sine-phase `dayK`/`nightK` driver instead of
rebuilding the original's true sun-elevation-angle math — same light
values, simpler driver, explicitly deferred rather than scope-creeped into
this pass (the user's own framing: "get the colors from index.html, we can
improve that later"). Road/sidewalk texture colors were checked against
the original and are already pixel-correct (`#23252a` asphalt, `#82868d`
sidewalk, verbatim) — what's still cut is texture *detail* (aggregate
speckle, wheel-path polish, oil stains, cracks, manholes, slab joints,
bump-mapped grain), already named honestly in Milestone 12, unchanged here.

**Side artifact, not part of the migration:** a separate `/crowd-test`
route (`components/CrowdScene.tsx`/`Buildings.tsx`/`Crowd.tsx`,
`lib/buildings.ts`) exists from an earlier unrelated ask this session (500
procedural buildings + 50 walking humans, prompted by an empty/failed
`buffalodataa.geojson` Overpass export). Not wired into the real game.
Worth knowing about: `scripts/optimize-character.mjs` (a checked-in
`@gltf-transform` decimation script, `npm run optimize:crowd`) exists from
an abandoned attempt to use a Mixamo GLB there — the source
`characters/walking.glb` turned out to be a mislabeled 161,634-vertex/
4096×4096-texture asset that crashed WebGL at 50 instances even after
decimation produced an ugly exaggerated-kick pose, so `/crowd-test`'s
walker was switched to the same procedural box-figure approach as the real
pedestrians. `characters/` (the ~440MB FBX/GLB folder) is still untouched,
still not staged/committed.

**Verification status — honest gap, not silently claimed done.**
`tsc --noEmit`/`eslint` clean on every file above. The lighting fix was
visually confirmed live (screenshot comparison at the VENU landmark: road/
sidewalk contrast, sign legibility, and pedestrian visibility all
measurably improved). The ragdoll hit-test was **not** confirmed live —
mid-verification the dev server's HMR left the HUD in a state with no
vehicle panel showing (car speed/name missing after a reload), and the
session was interrupted before root-causing whether that's a real bug or
just an HMR artifact from editing `Game.tsx` while the page was live. Next
session: hard-restart the dev server cleanly (don't rely on HMR surviving
a `Game.tsx`/`SkyCycle.tsx` edit), then actually drive into a pedestrian
and confirm the ragdoll fires.

**Files changed:** `components/Pedestrians.tsx`, `components/
PersonFigure.tsx` (new); `components/Crowd.tsx` (refactored onto
`PersonFigure`); `components/Game.tsx` (`Pedestrians` mount, `DynamicBloom`);
`components/SkyCycle.tsx` (hemisphere/fill lights, sun color, tone-mapping
exposure).

## Milestone 14 — world-scale restore + shore/drowning/pier physics (2026-07-26)

The coastline (`SHORE_X`/`SHORE_CI` in `lib/marina.ts`/`components/City.tsx`)
had been shrunk to `45`/`1` at some point, compressing the whole east side of
the map into a ~95-unit strip and putting the shore right next to VENU. Restored
to the original's real numbers (`SHORE_X=600`, `SHORE_CI=6`), and cascaded the
fix through everything anchored off the old value: `Water.tsx`'s plane, the
EAST MARINA/POLICE HARBOR landmarks, `PoliceStation.tsx`, and the
`policeCar`/`patrolBoat`/`boat` spawn defaults in `lib/vehicleState.ts` — all
shifted by the same delta so they still sit at the (real) shoreline instead of
floating in open water.

Fixed two real bugs found while restoring it: `Boat.tsx` had its old-shore
`x:40` default hardcoded in **two** places (a `pos` ref used every frame, and
a separate `RigidBody` JSX `position` prop) — only one got updated the first
pass, so the boat kept resting on dry land next to spawn. And the on-foot
`Player.tsx` had a doubled-transform bug: its visual `<group>` was a *child*
of the `RigidBody`, which already tracks the body's world position, but the
group's own position was *also* being set to that same absolute position every
frame — doubling the offset from spawn so the character rendered nowhere near
where the camera looked (invisible in practice). Fixed by giving the group a
constant local offset instead.

Added a real coastline: an invisible `VEHICLE_ONLY`-tagged wall (new
`lib/collisionGroups.ts` — group 0 = player, group 1 = vehicle-only geometry)
along the full length of the shore, with a gap at the marina pier that's
closed to cars/bikes but stays open for the on-foot player to walk out and
board the boat. Added a drowning timer to `Player.tsx`: >2s with `x >=
SHORE_X` on foot respawns at `START`. Traffic's fixed lane coordinates
(`Traffic.tsx`) didn't line up with the real road grid (asphalt only runs at
chunk-boundary multiples of `CELL`, i.e. `x/z ≡ 50 mod 100`) — realigned every
lane, including the police patrol lanes onto the police station's new
location.

Also relocated the VENU club exterior itself (`lib/club.ts`'s `CLUB`
constant): it sat at `(-50,-50)`, a road intersection, so the 38×28 building
straddled both streets. Moved to the center of the block one south of spawn,
clear of every road band.

**Files changed:** `lib/marina.ts`, `components/City.tsx` (`SHORE_CI`),
`components/Water.tsx`, `lib/landmarks.ts`, `components/PoliceStation.tsx`,
`lib/vehicleState.ts`, `components/Boat.tsx`, `components/Player.tsx`,
`components/Marina.tsx` (shore wall), `lib/collisionGroups.ts` (new),
`components/Traffic.tsx`, `lib/club.ts`.

## Milestone 15 — real Rapier dynamics, tree collision, redesigned maps (2026-07-26)

Every mover in the game (car/bike/police/player) is a Rapier `kinematicPosition`
body driven by hand-rolled arcade math — real dynamics (forces/impulses/
momentum) were unused anywhere. Added the first dynamic (non-kinematic)
bodies: a fixed pool of knockable props (traffic cones/barrels/crates,
`components/Props.tsx`) that a car physically shoves via the normal contact
solver, plus a pooled debris-fragment system that bursts on a hard crash
(`lib/debris.ts`'s `checkCrashDebris`, wired into `Car.tsx`/`Bike.tsx`/
`PoliceCar.tsx`, drained each frame by `Props.tsx`). The car/bike/police
`computeColliderMovement` calls now pass `QueryFilterFlags.EXCLUDE_DYNAMIC` so
the character-controller's obstacle sweep ignores these props — driving stays
exactly as tuned, a cone just gets knocked aside instead of stopping the car.

Trees (`City.tsx`) were flagged visual-only in the original file header ("no
tree collision — dressing, not an obstacle") — a car could drive straight
through one. Gave the trunk a real `CylinderCollider` (the crown stays
visual-only, matching how a real tree behaves). Also gave trees actual
canopy structure: 5 offset foliage lobes with tint variation instead of one
smooth sphere, plus 2 base-anchored branch stubs bridging trunk to canopy
(the first version centred the branch geometry, which left half its length
going nowhere instead of reaching the canopy — re-anchored to its root so
`scale.y=length` always reaches exactly that far).

Redesigned both maps (`Minimap.tsx`, `BigMap.tsx`): the street grid had been
drawn at chunk *centres* (multiples of `CELL`), a half-block off from where
`City.tsx` actually bakes asphalt (chunk *boundaries*, `x/z ≡ 50 mod 100`) —
landmarks and VENU in particular looked like they sat on the road. Redrawn
with the real grid, every landmark marker clamped to within ±20 of its block
centre so it reads as sitting on the footpath, brighter concrete-block palette,
water past the shore, non-overlapping staggered labels.

Also sharpened the road/sidewalk canvas texture (`buildTileTexture` in
`City.tsx`): canvas antialiases anything drawn at fractional pixel
coordinates, which is what made lane lines/curbs/crosswalks look soft —
snapped every coordinate to whole pixels, quadrupled the bake resolution
(384→1536), and switched the texture to `NearestFilter` + 16x anisotropy so
edges stay hard instead of bilinear-blurring up close.

**Files changed:** `components/Props.tsx` (new), `lib/debris.ts`,
`components/Car.tsx`, `components/Bike.tsx`, `components/PoliceCar.tsx`,
`components/City.tsx` (tree collider/detail, texture sharpening),
`components/Minimap.tsx`, `components/BigMap.tsx`, `components/Game.tsx`
(`Props` mount).

## Milestone 16 — zoned building variety: districts, 8 archetypes (2026-07-26)

The whole city was one archetype — a box, randomly sized, textured from a
shared facade/glass palette. Replaced it with a zoned district system:
`zoneFor(ci,cj)` in `City.tsx` groups chunks into 5x5-chunk (500x500 unit)
districts sharing one of 4 zones (downtown/office/residential/commercial),
hashed deterministically off the district coordinate so it reads as actual
neighbourhoods you drive between, with a ring of downtown districts around
spawn.

Each zone spawns genuinely different structures, not one shape re-tinted:

- **Downtown/office** — sparse (1-3 per block): glass **towers** (parapet cap
  + rooftop antenna), stone **offices** (parapet + rooftop AC units), and a
  residential **high-rise** (10-18 floors) for downtown's mixed-use skyline.
- **Residential** — a block is one of: an **apartment** block (3-5 floors,
  tiled windows + balconies front and back), an attached 3-unit **townhouse**
  row (one shared roofline/collider, but each unit hashes its own wall
  colour/door/windows off its own centre — distinct units within one
  structure), or a uniform **house/hut** row: one template (kind/size/colour)
  picked *once* per block and repeated across a 2x2 grid, so a street reads as
  one colony phase, not 4 independently randomised houses. Houses got real
  detail — door, flanking windows, optional side windows/chimney/porch, all
  hashed off the *block's* anchor coordinate (not each house's own position)
  so a uniform row's features actually match across the row.
- **Commercial** — a 3-shop storefront row, each shop one of 3 structural
  categories (not just a recolour): **retail** (glass storefront + sign),
  **cafe** (retail + a striped awning), or **garage** (auto shop/car wash —
  a real open drive-in bay: the collider only covers the back 2/3 of the
  footprint, so the car can actually pull into the front third and park, with
  a visible dark interior back wall). Every shop gets a readable business-type
  sign (`SHOP_TYPES`, 20 real categories) glued flat to the wall — an earlier
  version wrapped it in `<Billboard>`, which rotates to face the camera while
  the sign board stays fixed to the wall, so from any angle but dead-on the
  text visibly detached from its board; fixed by using a plain fixed `<Text>`
  (buildings never rotate, so nothing needs billboarding). Shop/house walls
  use flat single-colour materials instead of `FACADE_MATS` — that texture is
  a dense window-grid baked for 10+ unit towers, and tiled into a busy
  checkerboard ("mirror buildings") on an 8-unit shop or house wall.
  `FACADE_MATS` is now reserved for actual office/tower/apartment buildings
  tall enough for the texture's repeat scale to read correctly.
- **Every tower/office/apartment** got a ground-floor entrance (dark glass
  double-door + canopy overhang, shared `Entrance` component) — previously
  the facade ran straight to the ground with no way in.

**Files changed:** `components/City.tsx` (districts/zones, `BuildingSpec`,
8 archetype renderers, shop categories, entrances, shop signage).

## Milestone 17 — traffic collision avoidance, road names, poster signage, graffiti (2026-07-26)

Real bug: traffic cars are kinematic bodies driven purely by scripted lane
math with no collider at all — Rapier never resolves kinematic-vs-kinematic
overlap, so a parked player car (or any vehicle) had nothing stopping traffic
from driving straight through it. Added `laneBlocked()` (`Traffic.tsx`): before
advancing its scripted position each frame, a traffic car now checks the live
world position of `vehicleState.car/bike/policeCar` (kept current every frame
by their own components regardless of which is active, so an abandoned parked
car still blocks traffic) against its own lane line, and holds if one is ahead
within a braking distance — direction-aware, so it doesn't stall right after
clearing a car it just passed.

Added GTA5-style road names to the minimap (`Minimap.tsx`): every road line
(`x/z ≡ 50 mod 100`) gets a permanent name from two curated Buffalo, NY street
lists (hashed deterministically off which multiple of `CELL` it falls on, so
the same street always shows the same name), drawn curved along the street and
kept upright as the map rotates with heading.

Redesigned shop signage as an actual baked poster (icon + business name +
worn border on one canvas texture, cached per name/category/colour) instead
of a flat-coloured box with separate floating 3D text — reads as a printed
sign, not two independent objects. Added a category icon (wrench/cup/bag) per
sign. Added spray-paint graffiti decals (`SideGraffiti`) to house/apartment/
shop side walls — ~1 in 4-5 buildings, hashed per-position so it's stable,
using 4 baked transparent-background canvas textures.

**Files changed:** `components/Traffic.tsx` (obstacle check), `components/
Minimap.tsx` (street names), `components/City.tsx` (poster signage, category
icons, graffiti decals, `SIGN_TINTS` extracted from `SIGN_MATS`).

## Milestone 18 — weather, nitro FX, commercial traffic, airport + flyable aircraft (2026-07-30)

**Goal:** a batch of user-requested additions on top of the now-complete
whole-city base (Milestones 1-17) — weather parity with the original, a
visible nitro effect, three background-agent-built additions (commercial
traffic, an airport, flyable planes/helicopters), and a run of small bug
fixes surfaced along the way. Several pieces this milestone were built by
background `sonnet-craftsman` agents rather than directly, per this session's
own workflow — each one's diff was read and checked for bugs before being
folded in here, not taken on faith from the agent's own report.

**Weather ported from the original, with real wet-grip physics.**
`lib/weatherState.ts` (new) is a `WEATHER`/`WEATHER_W`-weighted picker +
`cycleWeather()` (bound to `V`), same shared-singleton pattern as
`skyState`/`worldState`. `components/Weather.tsx` (new) blends fog/background/
hemisphere-light and drives a 500-point rain particle system, deliberately
rendered *after* `<SkyCycle/>` in `Game.tsx` so it blends onto the same-frame
`scene.fog` SkyCycle already set rather than fighting it. `lib/carPhysics.ts`'s
grip formula now multiplies by `weatherState.wetGrip` (replacing a literal
`*1` placeholder) — affects all five vehicle types since they share
`stepCarPhysics`.

**Real nitro flame/exhaust, not just the HUD bar.** `components/NitroFX.tsx`
(new) is a 24-puff particle pool plus a two-cone flame rig with its own
`PointLight`, spawning while boosting, reading `vehicleState.car`.

**Restored the original's `H` key** (hide/show the `#controls` hint panel) —
`hudStore.controlsVisible` + `toggleControlsVisible()`, wired in `Game.tsx`'s
key handler. Hit a real Turbopack/SWC parser bug doing this the obvious way:
`{cond && (<div>...)}` conditional-mount JSX intermittently threw a
persistent "Expected '</', got 'ident'" parse error on the *next* line, even
with `tsc --noEmit` clean and a full cache clear — worked around by using
`style={{display: cond ? "block" : "none"}}` instead of conditional mount,
which doesn't trip the same parser path. Also dropped the `MOUSE pan camera`
and `G map / directions` lines from the displayed panel (redundant/already
known, per direct user ask) — display-only, the actual `G` keybinding in
`Game.tsx` was left untouched and re-verified still working.

**Fixed: player's own headlights stayed visibly lit even toggled OFF.**
`Headlights.tsx`'s shared `HEADLIGHT`/`TAILLIGHT`/`BEAM` materials are
deliberately global (so one `L` toggle doesn't dim an NPC three streets away)
— which meant the player's own car had no way to actually go dark. Added a
`lit` prop threaded `CarMesh` (`Car.tsx`) → `SupercarBody` (`SupercarBody.tsx`),
backed by new static `HEADLIGHT_OFF`/`TAILLIGHT_OFF` materials (never touched
by the day/night loop) and skipping the `BEAM` ground-light mesh entirely
(not just hiding it) when unlit. `StolenAwareCarMesh` now passes
`lit={hud.lightMode !== 2}`; every decorative parked car (MizuRestaurant.tsx)
now passes `lit={false}` so parked cars read as off, not idling.

**Commercial traffic — jeeps/buses/trucks, background agent, reviewed clean.**
`components/CommercialBody.tsx` (new) builds three genuinely different boxy
silhouettes (not a recolour of the sedan wedge) sharing one paint/glass/trim/
wheel material cache; `Traffic.tsx` tags 6 of its lanes with a `kind`, at
speeds slowed relative to their sedan-lane equivalents. Reviewed line-by-line
against `SupercarBody.tsx`'s export surface (confirmed `HEADLIGHT_OFF`/
`TAILLIGHT_OFF` really are module-private, so the local redeclaration was
correct, not an oversight) — no bugs found, `tsc`/lint clean.

**Airport + drivable planes/helicopters — background agent, reviewed clean.**
`components/Airport.tsx` (new): REGIONAL AIRPORT landmark at world
`(-300,100)` (chunk `(-3,1)`, confirmed free of every other landmark's
chunk) — runway, taxiway, apron, helipad, terminal + control tower with a
pulsing beacon, hangar, windsock, one shared `RigidBody` with 3
`CuboidCollider`s. `lib/flightPhysics.ts` (new) is a shared arcade flight
step (`stepFlight` + `PLANE_HANDLING`/`HELI_HANDLING`), same
"function + sibling handling-constant objects" shape as `carPhysics.ts`, but
its own model (vertical axis, ground floor, no tyre grip) rather than reusing
`stepCarPhysics`. `components/Plane.tsx`/`Helicopter.tsx` (new) are
kinematic, direct-integration rigs matching `PatrolBoat.tsx`'s idiom — mount
by walking up + `E` (added to `VehicleKind`, deliberately *not* added to the
`B`-cycle, same precedent as `policeCar`/`patrolBoat`). Reviewed against the
chunk/curb math (confirmed the whole layout fits inside the chunk's drivable
interior, apron/helipad don't overlap the terminal/hangar colliders, parked
`vehicleState.plane`/`.helicopter` coordinates land inside the apron/helipad
shapes) and against `PatrolBoat.tsx`'s own established pattern (confirmed the
RigidBody's initial JSX `position` ignoring a saved position on first mount
isn't a new bug — `PatrolBoat.tsx` has the exact same characteristic, it's
this codebase's accepted pattern for kinematic vehicles, not an oversight) —
no bugs found, `tsc`/lint clean.

**Real bug found and fixed after the user reported it: planes/helicopters
"drove on the road like any other car."** Root cause in `stepFlight`
(`lib/flightPhysics.ts`): the vertical-rate target defaulted to `0` unless
the `climb` key was *explicitly* held, so a grounded plane accelerating with
just `W` never left the ground — it just rolled forward, visually
indistinguishable from driving. Real planes don't need a separate button once
past takeoff speed; added a `mode === "plane"` branch so a grounded plane at
or above `liftMinSpeed` auto-rotates into a climb on its own (real runway
behaviour), while airborne cruise (holds altitude unless climb/descend held)
is unchanged. Helicopters deliberately excluded from the same rule —
`liftMinSpeed=0` means "always fast enough," so the same branch would launch
one the instant it's mounted, at rest, which isn't what "true hover" is
supposed to mean; helicopters still require an explicit `SPACE` to climb,
matching real collective-pitch control.

**In progress as of this writing:** a fourth background agent is scaling the
airport up and adding a security layer, per a follow-up user ask —
multi-chunk clearing around `(-3,1)` in `City.tsx` so the airfield reads as
its own isolated compound rather than sitting inside ordinary block-by-block
sprawl, a bigger runway/apron/terminal/hangar, a perimeter fence + gate, and
2-4 decorative parked police cars (reusing `PoliceCar.tsx`'s exported
`PoliceCarMesh`) near the entrance. Not yet reviewed or folded in — do that
before treating any of it as done.

**Verification status — same honest gap as every prior milestone's flight-
adjacent work.** All of the above is `tsc --noEmit`/lint clean per each
agent's own run (re-confirmed by direct review of the diffs, not taken on
faith), but **nothing in this milestone has been flown, driven, or visually
confirmed in a live browser** — this sandbox's synthetic keyboard-driving
input (`computer{action:"key"}`) doesn't reach the game's real controls (only
simple toggle-style `KeyboardEvent` dispatch via `javascript_tool` reliably
does), so there was no way to actually test drift/turn feel, the new
liftoff behaviour, weather's visual blend, or the commercial vehicles' lane
speeds. All handling constants in `flightPhysics.ts` are first-guess and
named as such in its own header comment — retune once someone actually flies
it.

**Files added:** `lib/weatherState.ts`, `components/Weather.tsx`,
`components/NitroFX.tsx`, `components/CommercialBody.tsx`,
`lib/flightPhysics.ts`, `components/Airport.tsx`, `components/Plane.tsx`,
`components/Helicopter.tsx`.
**Files changed:** `lib/carPhysics.ts` (wet-grip), `lib/hudStore.ts`
(`controlsVisible`, `plane`/`helicopter` `VehicleKind`), `components/HUD.tsx`
(`#controls` display toggle, trimmed legend lines), `components/Game.tsx`
(`H`/`V` keys, new component mounts), `components/Car.tsx`/`SupercarBody.tsx`
(`lit` prop + off-state materials), `components/MizuRestaurant.tsx` (parked
cars pass `lit={false}`), `components/Traffic.tsx` (commercial lane tagging),
`lib/landmarks.ts`/`lib/vehicleState.ts` (REGIONAL AIRPORT + plane/helicopter
entries).

## Milestone 19 — airport security layer: multi-chunk clearing, bigger compound, perimeter fence + gate, parked cruisers (2026-07-30)

**Goal:** fold in the item Milestone 18 left "in progress" — its background
security agent never actually landed any code (the worktree it was meant to
be running in, `.claude/worktrees/agent-af03d7d41032ac852`, diffed identical
to `main`; no task was tracked for it either), so this milestone builds the
security layer directly instead of reviewing someone else's diff.

**Multi-chunk clearing, not a bigger single chunk.** `components/City.tsx`
gained `AIRPORT_CHUNKS` — a 3x3 block centred on the airport's own chunk
`(-3,1)` (`Math.round(-300/CELL), Math.round(100/CELL)`) — added as a fourth
term in `Chunk`'s `isExempt` check alongside the spawn/landmark/club-interior
exemptions. Chunks outside that block still get ordinary buildings right up
to the fence line, so the compound reads as carved out of the city rather
than an oversized landmark chunk. Road-grid ground tiles still render inside
the cleared chunks (the exemption only skips `buildings`/`trees`, per
`Chunk`'s existing logic) — `Airport.tsx`'s own asphalt/apron surfaces sit on
top of that ground plane, same layering every other landmark already uses.

**Runway/apron/terminal/hangar scaled up to fill the new footprint**
(`components/Airport.tsx`): runway 56→100 units, apron 44×26→80×46, terminal
14×9→24×16, hangar 13×11→22×17 — roughly the same proportions, just sized for
a 300×300 compound instead of one 100×100 chunk. The helipad marking moved to
stay clear of the bigger terminal footprint; every other structure kept its
original relative layout (taxiway still connects runway to apron, hangar
still sits east of the terminal).

**Perimeter fence is 4 straight axis-aligned runs, not a generic polygon
walker** — the compound is a plain rectangle, so `FenceWallX`/`FenceWallZ`
just place one long chain-link panel + evenly-spaced posts per side, no
rotation math. A 22-unit gap in the east wall (the side facing the city) is
the gate. Each straight run gets its own `CuboidCollider` (5 total: north,
south, west, and the two segments flanking the gate gap) so a vehicle can
only get in through the opening — verified by hand after catching a sign
error in the first cut of the gap-segment half-extent math (was computing the
wrong side's length; fixed before it ever ran).

**Gate is checkpoint dressing, not a working barrier arm** — two pillars, an
overhead "AIRPORT SECURITY" sign beam, both with their own colliders. No
animated arm: nothing in this build tracks authorized-vs-not, so a barrier
that swings for every vehicle regardless would be a mechanic with nothing to
react to.

**3 parked cruisers posted just inside the gate**, reusing
`components/PoliceCar.tsx`'s `PoliceCarMesh` and
`components/ParkedPoliceJeep.tsx`'s `PoliceJeepMesh` — same
visual-only-no-collider convention `components/PoliceStation.tsx`'s own
fleet lot already established (drive-through dressing, not an obstacle),
not a new pattern invented for this milestone.

**Verified in a real browser, not just compiled.** `tsc --noEmit`/`eslint`
both clean. Rather than physically drive ~380 units from spawn, seeded
`localStorage`'s save slot directly with a vehicle spawned near the compound
and reloaded — confirmed live: the fence line, the gate's two pillars +
sign beam, and the parked cruisers all render at the correct position and
distance relative to the REGIONAL AIRPORT waypoint. Simple `computer{action:
"key"}` presses didn't reach the game's controls in this sandbox (same
finding Milestone 18 already named); raw `KeyboardEvent` dispatch via
`javascript_tool` did, and moved the bike at real speed — but steering back
through the gate itself for a straight-on drive-through shot wasn't nailed
down before wrapping up, so **the gate opening's collider gap has been
verified by hand-checked math and by seeing the compound render correctly
from outside, not by physically driving a vehicle through it on screen.**
Worth a real drive-through check next session.

**Files changed:** `components/City.tsx` (`AIRPORT_CHUNKS`, `isExempt`),
`components/Airport.tsx` (scaled dimensions, `FenceWallX`/`FenceWallZ`/
`PerimeterFence`/`Gate`/`GateGuardPost`).

## Milestone 20 — INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT rebuild: real scale, drivable wide-bodies, gate-access fix, empty field (2026-07-30)

**Goal:** the user's own airport walkthrough surfaced three real problems
with Milestone 18/19's airport — it read as a single small landmark, not a
"huge" international field; every parked aircraft was decoration, only the
one small prop plane and the helicopter were flyable; and it was either wide
open to city traffic or (after the first access fix) effectively unreachable.
This milestone rebuilds the field at real scale and fixes the access model
for real, not by hand-waving.

**The airport is now genuinely huge, not a scaled-up version of the old
single-chunk footprint.** `components/Airport.tsx` was rewritten wholesale:
a 420m runway with real threshold markings/piano-keys/touchdown-zone bars,
edge/threshold/PAPI lights and a 5-bar sequenced approach-lighting "rabbit"
off the 09 end (all `MeshBasicMaterial` emitters, no per-light real lights —
the scene's bloom pass is what makes them glow), a parallel taxiway with 3
connectors, a 470×200m apron, a 300m-long terminal pier with 3 jet bridges
and a real curtain-wall texture, a freestanding 52m control tower with a
rotating radar dish, two 74×62m maintenance hangars (one with its doors
open), a cargo yard with stacked shipping containers, a 3-tank fuel farm,
6 apron floodlight masts, and a 480×480m perimeter fence. `components/
Airport.tsx`'s exempted chunk radius in `City.tsx` grew from a 3x3 to a 5x5
block to match. New `lib/airportTextures.ts` bakes canvas textures for
runway asphalt, apron concrete, corrugated hangar/container steel, and the
terminal's lit curtain wall — same `canvasTex`/`NearestFilter`+anisotropy
idiom `City.tsx` already established, not a new pattern.

**Airliners are now built at real scale, not model-kit scale.**
`components/Airliner.tsx` (new) is a 58m nose-to-tail, 56m-span wide-body
— wings, twin underslung engines, a proper empennage, multi-wheel main
gear bogies — sized so standing under one next to the 1.8m pedestrian rig
reads as standing under a building, matching the user's explicit ask.
Three variants share one model: `livery` (6 paint schemes), `cargo` (swaps
the cabin window strip for a freighter's main-deck door), and `broken` (the
one deliberately un-flyable airframe: missing starboard wing + engine,
scorched skin, canted tail, sat on a jack instead of its right main gear).

**The field is alive, not a parked-car lot.** `components/AirportLife.tsx`
(new): a shared `usePathFollower` hook drives every mover — two wide-bodies
fly a full ~4-minute taxi→takeoff→climb-out→approach→land→taxi circuit
(`circuitKeys`), two freighters taxi a shorter ground-only loop
(`taxiKeys`), and 5 ground-service vehicles (tug, baggage train, fuel
bowser, stairs truck, catering lift, pushback tractor — each its own boxy
model, `WorkVehicleMesh`) run their own apron circuits. The broken jet's
maintenance bay (`BrokenJet`) has its removed wing and engine laid out on
trestles/stands, 3 scaffold towers with ladders, 2 flickering welding-arc
point lights, and a small fixed repair crew — the only humans anywhere on
the field, and the one place it was always meant to have people (see
below).

**Every parked wide-body is now a real vehicle, not a static prop —
the actual point of this milestone.** New `components/DrivableAirliner.tsx`
generalizes `Plane.tsx`'s kinematic-body/walk-up-and-`E` rig over an `id`,
so one component drives all 4 mountable airframes (`airliner1`/`2`/`3` at
the terminal's 3 gate stands, `airlinerCargo` on the cargo apron) —
`lib/hudStore.ts` gained a new `AirlinerId` union folded into `VehicleKind`,
`lib/vehicleState.ts` gained their parked coordinates (derived directly from
`Airport.tsx`'s own gate/cargo-apron layout constants, not guessed), and
`lib/flightPhysics.ts` gained `AIRLINER_HANDLING` — heavy and slow to turn
(`turnRate` a quarter of the small plane's), needing a real ~110m takeoff
roll before `liftMinSpeed` (26 m/s) lets it climb, well inside the new
420m runway. Mounting one is identical to mounting the existing small
plane/helicopter: walk up, press `E`. The broken jet is the deliberate
exception named directly in the user's own ask ("unless it's broken or
under construction") — it has no `vehicleState` entry and no mount trigger
at all, by construction, not by a runtime check.

**Real bug found and fixed: the airport was reachable by ordinary city
traffic with zero collision.** The user reported cars driving straight into
the compound and back out "without any touches." The gate gap in Milestone
19's perimeter fence had no collider at all — open to everything. Fixed by
adding one `CuboidCollider` across the gap tagged `VEHICLE_ONLY`
(`lib/collisionGroups.ts`) — the same interaction-groups trick
`Marina.tsx`'s shore wall already uses to block cars/bikes/traffic while
staying invisible to the player's own on-foot collider (verified against
Rapier's actual bitmask rule: `VEHICLE_ONLY`'s membership bit doesn't
intersect the player collider's filter bits, so the math guarantees a
pedestrian passes through regardless of gap width). NPC `Traffic.tsx` never
reaches the airport's coordinates in the first place (its lanes are all
within ±85 units of spawn), so this specifically stops the player's own car
from driving in and stops nothing else from working.

**Second real bug, found only after re-testing the first fix live: the
gate itself was unfindable.** Sealing vehicles out is only correct if a
pedestrian can actually *find* the opening — the first pass left the gate a
28m gap floating mid-block in a 480m wall, off any road, which is why "make
sure the player can get in" kept failing in live testing even after the
collider fix was correct. Moved the gate to `GATE_CZ = -50` (world z = 50),
a real road centreline (`components/City.tsx`'s grid puts asphalt at
`x/z ≡ 50 mod 100`), and widened it to 60m. A car now drives straight up to
the gate on the city's own road grid, hits the `VEHICLE_ONLY` wall, and has
to U-turn — exactly the "take a U-turn... but not inside" behaviour asked
for, achieved by routing, not a special-cased block. The 3 decorative
parked cruisers (`GateGuardPost`) moved to flank the new gate position.
**Verified live, not just by code review**: drove a car up to the new gate
and confirmed it stops dead at the fence line (speed drops and stays
pinned across repeated throttle, several real physics frames apart);
dismounted with `E` and walked the same path on foot, confirmed reaching
the interior grass/apron with a parked airliner visible ahead, past where
the car had been stopped.

**Third real bug: ordinary city pedestrians could wander onto the runway.**
Not just the airport's own added crew — `components/Pedestrians.tsx`'s
civilian spawn range (`ci` -3..0, `cj` -3..3) and its rehome-near-the-player
logic both happen to cover the airport's exact chunk block, and neither
knew the airport existed. A civilian rehoming while the player is anywhere
near the field would land inside the fence, on foot, past the same
`VEHICLE_ONLY` wall that (correctly) doesn't apply to them. Exported
`AIRPORT_CHUNKS` from `City.tsx` and added a small retry-until-clear helper
(`pickCityBlock`) to both `Pedestrians.tsx` call sites (initial spawn and
rehome) so no ordinary civilian or beat-cop NPC ever picks an airport
block. Combined with removing every ambient NPC `Airport.tsx` itself used
to place (guard patrols, terminal foot traffic, per-gate ground crew), the
field's only people are now the fixed repair team in the maintenance bay —
matching the user's explicit "I want no one inside" (with that one named,
deliberate exception, since it's the working scene they asked for
directly).

**Fourth real bug: a genuine glitch, not a perception issue — bank angle
spiked on frame-rate variance.** `AirportLife.tsx`'s `usePathFollower`
originally derived each mover's roll from `(this frame's heading change) /
(this frame's dt)` — mathematically reasonable at a constant frame rate, but
a stutter (more likely now that the airport renders far more geometry than
before) spikes the estimate and snaps the roll visibly. Replaced with a
frame-rate-independent estimate: sample the path's own heading at two fixed
points in *path time* (0.35s apart, both derived from `s.clock.elapsedTime`
directly, not from how long the last frame took) and smooth toward that at
a normal fixed rate. Every mover on the field (both circuit airliners, both
taxiing freighters) uses this same shared function, so this is a real,
global smoothness fix, not a per-instance patch.

**Not done this milestone, named honestly:** a broader draw-call/perf pass
was requested ("optimize so planes run smoothly") but only the bank-angle
correctness bug above was actually fixed — geometry segment counts in
`Airliner.tsx` are still uninstanced/un-reduced (each aircraft is ~70+
individual meshes: fan blades, gear, fairings), and the runway/taxiway/
approach light spheres and cargo containers in `Airport.tsx` are still one
draw call each rather than `InstancedMesh`. With up to 9 aircraft instances
live at once this is the field's real remaining performance cost and the
next thing worth profiling before adding more per-aircraft detail.

**Files added:** `components/Airliner.tsx`, `components/AirportLife.tsx`,
`components/DrivableAirliner.tsx`, `lib/airportTextures.ts`.
**Files rewritten:** `components/Airport.tsx` (real scale, textures,
lighting, drivable-vehicle wiring, gate relocation).
**Files changed:** `components/City.tsx` (5x5 `AIRPORT_CHUNKS`, exported for
`Pedestrians.tsx`), `components/Pedestrians.tsx` (`pickCityBlock` airport
exclusion), `lib/hudStore.ts` (`AirlinerId`, `VEHICLE_NAMES`),
`lib/vehicleState.ts` (4 new parked-airliner entries), `lib/flightPhysics.ts`
(`AIRLINER_HANDLING`), `lib/landmarks.ts` (REGIONAL → INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT), `components/Game.tsx` (mounts the 4 `DrivableAirliner`s),
`components/Helicopter.tsx` (`HeliMesh` exported, reused for parked
decorative helis).

## Milestone 21 — three small fixes off Milestone 20's own "Next up" list (2026-07-31)

**Goal:** Milestone 20 closed with a long list of named-but-not-done items.
This picks off the three that were genuinely small and well-scoped rather
than the big ones (airport perf pass, live flight-testing the new
handling numbers) — real code, not more testing.

**BigMap now has street names, same source as Minimap.** `Minimap.tsx` had
a pure `streetName(coord, axis)` function + two name lists, naming every
road deterministically; `BigMap.tsx` drew the identical road grid with no
labels at all. Extracted both into new `lib/streetNames.ts` so the two
maps import one canonical source instead of (as it would have been) two
copies that could drift — a road shows the same name on both maps by
construction. `BigMap.tsx` is fixed north-up and never rotates, so its
version skips all of `Minimap.tsx`'s upright-angle math; it just draws each
label flat along its road (vertical roads rotated 90°, horizontal roads
plain). Verified live: opened the map, every visible road on both axes is
labeled and matches the minimap's names for the same streets.

**The car itself now loses speed when it hits a pedestrian.**
`Pedestrians.tsx` already had the full ragdoll + hit-test port; the
original's `v.speed*=0.9` on the vehicle's own side, fired in the same beat,
had never been ported. The wiring problem: `Pedestrians.tsx` has no way to
reach into `Car.tsx`/`Bike.tsx`/`PoliceCar.tsx`'s own component-local speed
refs directly. Added `lib/pedestrianHit.ts` — a one-shot signal in the same
shape as the existing `lib/playerTeleport.ts` (set by the component that
detects the event, consumed-and-cleared by the interested component on its
own next frame) — set the instant a hit registers, consumed by whichever
land vehicle is actually driving at the same spot each of the three already
calls `checkCrashDebris`.

**Aircraft mount-hint is now a real 3D distance, not x/z only.** The named
bug: a plane/helicopter flying overhead reads as "in range, press E" from
directly underneath on the ground. Root cause was that nothing tracked
altitude anywhere — `vehicleState` was typed `{x,z,h}` only, and
`worldState` had no `y` at all. Added `y?: number` to `vehicleState` (only
`Plane.tsx`/`Helicopter.tsx` ever write it, next to their existing x/z/h
writes each frame; every other vehicle stays close enough to ground/water
level that a missing `y` defaulting to 0 is correct) and `py` to
`worldState` (written by `Player.tsx` on foot, next to its existing
px/pz/heading write). `lib/player.ts`'s mount scan now compares
`dx²+dy²+dz²` against the same `MOUNT_RADIUS2` instead of `dx²+dz²`.

All three: `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` clean, `next build` green.

## Next up

World-scale, physics, maps, building variety, and city texture/detail
(Milestones 14-17) are now a cohesive whole city on top of the fidelity work
in Milestones 1-13; Milestone 18 layers weather, nitro FX, commercial
traffic, and a flyable airport on top of that; Milestone 19 adds a security
perimeter; Milestone 20 rebuilds the airport at real scale with drivable
wide-bodies and fixes the three real access/population bugs the user found
by actually playing it; Milestone 21 closes three of Milestone 20's smaller
named gaps. Remaining, roughly by size:
**a draw-call/perf pass on the airport specifically** — named honestly as
not done in Milestone 20 (segment-count reduction + `InstancedMesh` for
engine fan blades, runway/taxiway/approach lights, and cargo containers;
up to 9 full aircraft instances is the field's real cost);
**fly a drivable airliner end-to-end in a real browser** (mount at a gate,
taxi, take off, land) to confirm `AIRLINER_HANDLING`'s first-guess numbers
feel right, same as `PLANE_HANDLING`/`HELI_HANDLING` still need per
Milestone 18's own note; **fly the small plane/helicopter and drive through
weather at least once in a real browser** to confirm the liftoff behaviour
and handling constants feel right; **verify Milestone 13's ragdoll hit-test
live** (carried over, still unconfirmed); the club interior's own
deliberate simplifications (Milestone 9); the felony-stop convoy maneuver
named and skipped in Milestone 11; a perf pass on the rest of the city now
that Milestones 16-18 add meaningfully more meshes per chunk/landmark
(towers/apartments/townhouses/graffiti/commercial-vehicle bodies each render
several sub-meshes); the garage bay's side walls/roof have no collider by
design (visual only, so pulling in never gets stuck) — worth a follow-up
pass if a player manages to clip through a side wall at speed;
`laneBlocked()` only checks the 3 land vehicles, not other traffic cars
against each other; and the still-unconfirmed `dpr={1}`/`EffectComposer`
render artifact from Milestone 13, still worth a real-hardware check.
